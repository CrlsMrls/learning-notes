# Jobs

A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate. 

- [Jobs](#jobs)
  - [Creation](#creation)
  - [Repeat until failure](#repeat-until-failure)
  - [Complete X times](#complete-x-times)
  - [Parallelize](#parallelize)
  - [Debugging Jobs](#debugging-jobs)


## Creation

Create a Job with command line:

```bash
k create job  pi-job -o yaml --dry-run=client --image=perl:5.34.0 >  pi.yaml
```

The `.spec.template` is a pod template and the only required field of the .spec.

The `RestartPolicy` can only be `Never` or `OnFailure`.


```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
...
```

## Repeat until failure

The `.spec.backoffLimit` specifies the number of retries before considering a Job as failed. The back-off limit is set by default to 6. 


```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  backoffLimit: 15 # The job retries 15 times before it quits
  template:
    spec:
      ...
```

## Complete X times

Use `.spec.completions` to 

```yaml
spec:
  completions: 3
  backoffLimit: 25 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
```

## Parallelize

Use `.spec.parallelism` to 

```yaml
spec:
  completions: 3
  backoffLimit: 25 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
```
## Debugging Jobs

As Jobs are run in a Pod, debugging is similar to pods. 

- get the job completion information
- describe the job. `Pods Statuses` lists when the Job fails and how many times.
- find the pod name and describe the pod
- if the pod created some content, check it with the logs
- to restart the job, it must be deleted first

```bash
$ kubectl get job my-job
NAME     COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE

After fixing it, the status should be `Completed`.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods my-job-9nb88
